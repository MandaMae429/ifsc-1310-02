    <h2>Thoughts on Web Accessibility</h2>
  </header>
  <p>Web accessibility is a necessity for people all over the world. Whether due to aging, a temporary disability, or a lifelong issue, accessibility allows everyone to use the web. Accessibility to me means the ability to live as independently as possible no matter what has or has not happened in your life. Even people who are neurotypical or not disabled have many uses for accessibility options, but I am a user of them from the learning disability side. Apps that read to me help me understand dense material more easily. Options that allow me to turn off all the noise around an article Iâ€™m reading help me stay focused. Keyboarding accessibility allows for people with vision issues to use the web easier than they would have been able to.</p> 
  <p>It is important to build websites that are equally accessible to anyone using the internet. Access to the internet in 2024 is an undeniable necessity. As programmers we should be programming in a way that everyone can browse and understand what they find, through whatever means we need to use. Web accessibility allows us to give an independent option to anyone needing to use the internet.</p>
