  <h2>Thoughts on Web Accessibility</h2>

  <section class="container" id="content">

  <p>Web accessibility is a necessity for people all over the world. Whether due to aging, a temporary disability, or a lifelong issue, accessibility allows everyone to use the web. Accessibility to me means the ability to live as independently as possible no matter what has or has not happened in your life. Even people who are neurotypical or not disabled have many uses for accessibility options, but I am a user of them from the learning disability side. Apps that read to me help me understand dense material more easily. Options that allow me to turn off all the noise around an article I’m reading help me stay focused. Keyboarding accessibility allows for people with vision issues to use the web easier than they would have been able to.</p> 
  <p>It is important to build websites that are equally accessible to anyone using the internet. Access to the internet in 2024 is an undeniable necessity. As programmers we should be programming in a way that everyone can browse and understand what they find, through whatever means we need to use. Web accessibility allows us to give an independent option to anyone needing to use the internet.</p>

  <h2>Web Page Revision and Reflection</h2>
  <section class="container" id="content">
    <p>My reviewer enjoyed the organization of my web page, as well as the focus on accessibility seen throughout my design. They thought the colors went well together. They suggested I work on my design consistency, and that I should add more visual appeal with images or interactive elements. I did redesign the pages in my final page, and adding more images into an interactive slide show.</p>
    <p>One of the things I think I did particularly well was focusing on making my pages accessible. I paid close attention to ensuring that my content could be easily navigated by users with disabilities, such as implementing proper semantic HTML, descriptive alt text for images, and clear headings for better structure. I also ensured that the design was keyboard-friendly and that color contrasts met accessibility guidelines. These efforts helped create a more inclusive experience for all users, which I feel is an essential part of good web design. Here is the link to my revised version: <a href="final/index.html">Final Project</a>
    </p>
    <p>Another thing I believe I did well was in crafting my HTML markup. I focused on writing clean, semantic code that not only structured the content effectively but also enhanced accessibility and SEO. I used proper HTML elements to ensure the content was logically organized, such as headings for clear hierarchy, lists for structured data, and forms that were user-friendly. By paying attention to these details, I was able to create a strong foundation for my web pages, making them easy to maintain and extend in the future.
    </p>
    <p>If I had to start over again, I would try to be more prepared for the information being given. While I made progress, sometimes I felt overwhelmed by the amount of new concepts and terminology introduced. Taking a little more time to review key topics ahead of time, setting clearer goals for each lesson, and seeking additional resources would have helped me absorb the material more effectively. This proactive approach would have made the learning process smoother and allowed me to feel more confident as I tackled new challenges.

<h2>Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement</h2>
  <section class="container" id="content">
    <p>Progressive enhancement is a web development approach that puts the focus on delivering a solid, accessible experience for everyone, regardless of the technology they’re using. It starts with the basics—core content and functionality—and then adds layers of styling (CSS) and interactivity (JavaScript) as optional enhancements. This way, even users with older browsers, slower devices, or JavaScript disabled can still use the website effectively.</p>

    <p>In today’s landscape of diverse devices, unpredictable networks, and evolving technologies, progressive enhancement ensures that websites are fast, accessible, and reliable for all users. It’s an approach that prioritizes inclusivity and performance, creating a better web experience for everyone.</p>
