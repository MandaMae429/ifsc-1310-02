<p>History
The U.S. Equestrian Federation (USEF) has a rich history as the national governing body for equestrian sports in the United States. Its development reflects a longstanding commitment to equestrian excellence, competition standards, and horse welfare.

Founding and Early Years

USEF’s roots date back to 1917 when the organization was initially established as the American Horse Shows Association (AHSA). AHSA was created to regulate and promote equestrian events across the country, establishing the standards and rules needed to ensure fair and safe competitions. In its early years, the AHSA focused on setting uniform rules, particularly for hunter and jumper classes, to standardize judging and competition formats.

Evolution and Mergers

In the 20th century, equestrian sports gained popularity and recognition globally, especially as events were added to the Olympic Games and other major international competitions. The AHSA grew, evolving alongside these sports, and expanded its governance to include a wider range of equestrian disciplines.

In 2001, the organization underwent a significant transformation when it merged with the United States Equestrian Team (USET), the organization responsible for fielding U.S. equestrian teams in international competitions. This merger was pivotal in aligning the development of national equestrian talent with international competitive goals. Following the merger, the AHSA and USET became known as USA Equestrian for a short time before officially rebranding as the U.S. Equestrian Federation (USEF) in 2003.

Modern USEF: Governing Body for Equestrian Sports

Today, USEF serves as the recognized governing body by the United States Olympic & Paralympic Committee (USOPC) and the International Federation for Equestrian Sports (FEI). It oversees 29 different equestrian disciplines, which include both Olympic and non-Olympic sports like dressage, eventing, show jumping, reining, and vaulting. USEF’s responsibilities encompass setting rules, certifying officials, ensuring horse welfare, and promoting safe and ethical practices in equestrian sports.

	•	Horse Welfare Standards: USEF has continued to expand its horse welfare policies, enforcing strict anti-doping rules and guidelines for humane treatment and safety of competition horses.

Current Role and Mission

Today, USEF stands as a comprehensive body supporting over 100,000 members and certifying more than 2,500 competitions annually across the United States. With a commitment to excellence, USEF promotes not only competitive standards but also educational resources, rider development, and support for grassroots equestrian activities.
