<p>The United States Equestrian Federation (USEF) is the national governing body for equestrian sports in the United States, dedicated to fostering excellence, fairness, and safety in equestrian competition. Established in 1917, USEF oversees and regulates a wide range of equestrian disciplines, including dressage, eventing, jumping, hunter, and more.

USEF provides a unified structure for equestrian sports, offering rule enforcement, athlete education, and training opportunities for riders at all levels—from grassroots programs to elite competition. As the representative body for equestrian sports in the U.S., USEF also manages the selection and preparation of national teams for international events, such as the Olympics and World Equestrian Games, in partnership with the Fédération Équestre Internationale (FEI).

With a commitment to horse welfare, athlete support, and inclusivity, USEF strives to grow and support the equestrian community across the nation. From setting competition standards to inspiring the next generation of equestrians, USEF serves as the heart of equestrian sport in the United States.</p>
